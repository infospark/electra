Suspect don't need a huge improvement over the model to move up rankings

Could validate dates and numbers and places - and then match to "where" - etc - feed that into another NN?
Could validate maybe >50% of questions by re-asking with the answer - does that help? e.g. weed out or strengthen answers?
    Possibly it also helps to identify the more complete answer sometimes?
        "Replay the quesion with answer as subject" - example below - works anecdotally
Occasionally see examples where questions reference prior questions - e.g. "When did it retract to inland formation" .. referring to rainforest in prior question
    Could look at the subject or answer from prior questions? (https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/explore/v2.0/dev/Amazon_rainforest.html?model=nlnet%20(single%20model)%20(Microsoft%20Research%20Asia)&version=v2.0)
Occasionally see examples where the question assumes general knowledge - e.g. Canterbury is in England (Huguenots)

Try getting the question back out using the answer - then comparing the question and the retrieved question
Interesting - there's no mention of England in the text - it's assumed general knowledge ....
.... Question refers to a location not mentioned in the text?
... Say I found out that Canterbury was in England - then what can i do?
.. add "in England" to the text - gets a stronger score
.. look at text, any reference to a place or a date/time we can add context but only if it's referenced in a question? otherwise why?

Other evidence of the Walloons and Huguenots in Canterbury in England includes a block of houses in Turnagain Lane, where weavers' windows survive on the top floor, as many Huguenots worked as weavers. The Weavers, a half-timbered house by the river, was the site of a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830. (It has been adapted as a restaurant—see illustration above. The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.) Others refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population. Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees' initial acceptance in the City. They also settled elsewhere in Kent, particularly Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone—towns in which there used to be refugee churches.
